# SNP Position Identifier ðŸ§¬

This beginner-friendly Python tool compares two DNA sequences of equal length and identifies all **single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** â€” differences in bases at each position.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Takes two user-input DNA sequences
2. Compares them base by base
3. Prints all mismatches and their positions
